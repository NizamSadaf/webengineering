                    <strong>CSE at IST</strong><br><br>
                    Institute of Science and Technology (IST) was offered B.Sc honors in Computer Science in 1993, the first institute under National University of Bangladesh. At the very beginning, the department had only 46 students in the program. Later in 2005-2006 it was renamed as Computer Science and Engineering (CSE).  Since then IST is committed to excellence in learning, research and developing professionals in CSE, who make a difference internationally. So far in 23 batches more than 1400 students have been awarded B.Sc. Engineering. The M.Sc program started in 1996-1997 session. Now more than 400 students have completed M.Sc in CSE. Among the graduates 17 of them have completed Ph.D. We have full time faculty members including Professor, Associate Professor, Assistant Professor, and Lecturer from renowned universities like University of Dhaka, IST, Mawlana Bhashani Science and Technology University.
